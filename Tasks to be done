Tasks to be done

General:
Animation integration from html spec to angular across the forms
	- Admin create/edit (banks, customer, users)
	- Single LC add notes
	- Icons in the side bar

Angular form validation
	- Admin create/edit (banks,customer,users)
	- Upload new LC
	- Amend LC
	- Clause manager forms need to be revised. (I will probably need to provide some clarification. There's no html template so we'll be winging the designs)

Notification fetches and navbar display (I still need to finish writing the api for this. I'll let you know when it's finished)
